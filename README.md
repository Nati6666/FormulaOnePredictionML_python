Formula 1 Driver Predictions
This repository contains a Python script that predicts the final points of Formula 1 drivers for the 2025 season, based on their current performance in the season so far. It uses historical data to estimate each driver’s points at the end of the season, assuming their average performance continues.

Key Features:
Driver Data: The dataset includes driver names, teams, and points accumulated so far.

Predicted Final Points: The script calculates each driver's projected points for the rest of the season.

Comparison Tool: The script allows users to compare two drivers and determine who is predicted to score more points.

Technologies Used:
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/f1-driver-predictions.git
cd f1-driver-predictions
Install dependencies: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the necessary packages using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Run the script:

Execute the script with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
python driver_predictions.py
Compare two drivers:

The script will ask for two drivers’ names, then return who is predicted to score more points based on their current performance and predicted remaining races.

View Predictions:

The script will display a bar plot showing the predicted final points for each driver in the 2025 season.

How It Works
Step-by-Step Explanation:
Input Data: The dataset contains the list of drivers, their respective teams, current points, and races completed.

Prediction Formula:

The predicted final points for each driver are calculated by:

Predicted Final Points
=
Current Points
+
(
Current Points
Races Completed
)
×
(
Total Races
−
Races Completed
)
Predicted Final Points=Current Points+( 
Races Completed
Current Points
​
 )×(Total Races−Races Completed)
This formula assumes that drivers continue performing at their average rate for the remainder of the season.

Comparison:

A comparison function allows you to input the names of two drivers to determine who is predicted to score more points.

Visualization:

A bar plot visualizes the predicted total points of all drivers, with the driver expected to score the most points displayed at the top.

Example:
Here’s a sample of how to use the comparison function:

python
Copy
Edit
print(compare_driver("Norris", "Verstappen"))
This will output something like:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Norris is predicted to score 8.0 more points than Verstappen.
